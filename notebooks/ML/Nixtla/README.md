# Nixtla Tutorial

The Flash team is excited to share with you a small tutorial on how to use Nixtla.

## What is Nixtla ? ðŸ¤”

Nixtla is a Python library designed to simplify time series forecasting.

Nixtlaâ€™s ecosystem offers several packages, including the following:

- **StatsForecast** package: Which offers a wide range of statistical and econometric models such as Theta, ARIMA, ETS, etc. on a shelf
- **TSFeature** package: This package allows you to compute various features from time series data, helping you to understand and extract meaningful information from your datasets.
- **mlforecast** package: This package lets you handle all the time series feature engineering elements and two forecasting methods: recursive forecast (one model, multiple time steps prediction) and chained forecast (one model per time step prediction).
You also have the possibility to utilize models from sci-kit-learn or other boosting libraries.
- **hierarchicalforecast** package: this package enables you to apply popular methods of hierarchical forecast reconciliation, such as MINTS, BottomUp, TopDown, etc. Additionally, it offers a tool to construct a hierarchical dataset.
- **neuralforecast** package: this package provides several state-of-the-art deep learning models on a shelf, if we want to name some of us, thereâ€™s TemporalFusionTransformer, LSTM, NBEATS, NHITS, etc.

## Why should I use Nixtla ?

Here are some reasons why you might consider using Nixtla:

- **An all-in-one tool for time-series forecasting**: It offers various tools and functionalities that streamline the process of building, training, and evaluating forecasting models.
- **Rich implementation of multiple time-series/ML technics**: It has a very rich and well-documented library of statistical and machine learning models.
- **Support conformal predictions and hierarchical reconciliation**: It also provides ways to achieve conformal predictions, hierarchical reconciliation, and more. Lots of very useful tools for us, data scientists, in our forecasting tasks.

## What are Nixtla's limitations ?

It really seems like the dream tool, why not using it all the time ? Well, here's some limitations you should be aware of:
- **Multiple dependencies**: A large number of distinct libraries are required from the Nixtla ecosystem in order to achieve a basic end-to-end
forecasting project.
- **Performance**: The performance can be slow when experimenting with very large dataset.
Luckily, Nixtla integrates well with distributed systems like Spark (more about it [here](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/statsforecast/blog/posts/2022-10-05-distributed-fugue/index#statsforecast-code))
Note that, it has also been noticed that Pycharm can crash when plotly is used as an engine for visualization.
- **Documentation**: Although their documentation is very rich, it can easily be overwhelming to find what you're looking for.
For instance, multiple versions (some of them obsolete) of the same evaluation methodology can be found in their documentations.
