The primary objective of the Flash initiative is to equip you with a toolkit that enhances the speed and efficiency of your daily tasks as a Data Scientist!

The tools in our curated list are selected based on a couple of criteria:

- üë• Relevance to Ivado Labs projects. Qualitative value: low, medium, high.
- üë®‚Äçüíª Ease of use/installation. Qualitative value: low, medium, high.
- üìñ Quality of the available documentation. Qualitative value: low, medium, high.
- ü•áü•àü•â (if applicable) Project quality score from [best of ML](https://github.com/ml-tooling/best-of-ml-python) initiative. Quantitative value.
- ‚≠ê (if applicable) GitHub Star Count. Quantitative value.
